# AI
This is a mini-project by Aymane Ftissi and Azzedine Herradi for the AI class in M1 IWMBigData.

This project aims to create an application that detects sign language movements in real time and display what the person is trying to say.

We used Jupyter Notebook and LabelImg as technologies for this work.
The coding language is Python.
